<b>Description</b>

The website can give the user the current weather in his/her location, information like average temperature throughout the day, weather description,
maximum and minimum temperatures of the day for upcoming 3 days. The user can also search for any city and get the current weather and all the above mentioned 
information for the searched city as well.

<b>Problems Faced</b>

Figuring out how to link the data provided in the response to required elements so that they are displayed properly. I tried to use Google maps autocomplete feature so while 
the user is typing suggestions are provided which help the user. But I couldn't make it work.

<b>Scope of Improvement</b>

Currently the website only gives weather information only if the user types the correct spelling of the location, it doesn't inform the user if he/she commits a mistake while
typing the location. So informing the user that the typed location is not correct or there is a spelling mistake so that he/she can correct the mistake. Or to eradicate this 
error by adding autocomplete so that the user gets a correct response everytime. Styling the website so that it is more responsive and good looking. 
Providing an option to save few places so that user can get the weather of those locations by clicking on them instead so typing the location.
